**RP2040 output modes:** **USB device:** XInput (Xbox 360 + XSM3), DInput, PS3, **Switch Pro** (Nintendo Switch Pro Controller emulation), Wii U, **Wii (Wiimote, build-option only)**, Xbox OG (Gamepad / Steel Battalion / XRemote), PS Classic, Web App. **GPIO (no USB device):** PS1/PS2, Dreamcast, GameCube, N64 — use any wired USB or (on Pico W / Pico 2 W) Bluetooth controller as input. **Wii, GameCube, and N64 are not in the combo list** — use a dedicated build for those modes (see below).

## Changing platforms
By default the OGX-Mini will emulate an OG Xbox controller, you must hold a button combo for 3 seconds to change which platform you want to play on. Your chosen mode will persist after powering off the device. 

Start = Plus (Switch) = Options (Dualsense/DS4)

- XInput (Xbox 360)
    - Start + Dpad Up 
- Original Xbox
    - Start + Dpad Right
- Original Xbox Steel Battalion
    - Start + Dpad Right + Right Bumper
- Original Xbox DVD Remote
    - Start + Dpad Right + Left Bumper
- Switch (Pro Controller emulation)
    - Start + Dpad Down
- PlayStation 3
    - Start + Dpad Left
- PlayStation Classic
    - Start + A (Cross for PlayStation and B for Switch gamepads)
- PlayStation 1 / PlayStation 2 (GPIO output)
    - Start + B
- Dreamcast (GPIO output)
    - Start + Y
- Wii U (GameCube Adapter)
      - Start + Left Bumper + D-Pad Down
- Web Application Mode
    - Start + Left Bumper + Right Bumper

**Wii, GameCube, and N64 are not selectable by combo.** Use a dedicated build for those modes:

- **Wii (Wiimote):** `-DOGXM_FIXED_DRIVER=WII`. See [Wii Mode Guide](Firmware/RP2040/docs/Wii_Mode_Guide.md).
- **GameCube (GPIO):** `-DOGXM_FIXED_DRIVER=GAMECUBE`. Example (Pico 2 W Debug):  
  `cmake -DOGXM_BOARD=PI_PICO2W -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DOGXM_FIXED_DRIVER=GAMECUBE ..` then `ninja`. Flash `OGX-Mini-*-GAMECUBE.uf2`. Use `PI_PICOW` for Pico W.
- **N64 (GPIO):** `-DOGXM_FIXED_DRIVER=N64`. Example (Pico 2 W Debug):  
  `cmake -DOGXM_BOARD=PI_PICO2W -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DOGXM_FIXED_DRIVER=N64 ..` then `ninja`. Flash `OGX-Mini-*-N64.uf2`.

Input for GPIO modes is Bluetooth or USB; no combo switching in these builds.

After a new mode is stored, the RP2040 will reset itself so you don't need to unplug it.

## Disconnecting Controllers
For most controllers pressing and holding Start+Select (+/-, etc) for the controller will disconnect it and restart pairing mode.
For the OUYA controller there is no Start+Select, the disconnection combo has been set to L3+R3.

## Supported devices
### Wired controllers (USB input)
The following work when the adapter is outputting to any supported platform (Xbox, Switch, XInput, PS3, DInput, **PS1/PS2**, **Dreamcast**, **GameCube**, **N64**, etc.):

# Features new to this fork:
Note: These features have been added to the Pico W/ Pico 2 W firmware support, I do not have the other boards to test and implement the same fixes at this time.

### Version 1.0.0.7a
- **OG Xbox mode stability** — Report sending was reverted to v1.0.0a5 behaviour: the adapter only builds and sends the HID report when new gamepad input is available (`new_pad_in()`). Sending every poll cycle caused random disconnects on the Original Xbox; the reversion restores stable operation. Rumble handling is unchanged.
- **PS2 (GPIO) / OPL stability** — The PS2 controller protocol response was reverted so the first response byte is the mode byte (no leading 0xFF). This restores compatibility with Open PS2 Loader and games; OPL no longer hangs at startup with the adapter connected. Core layout: Core1 runs Bluetooth when used; Core0 runs the main loop and PS2 device poll.
- **Xbox 360 (XInput) wake from standby** — When the 360 was turned off via **Guide → Turn off console** (soft shutdown), you can power it back on with the controller: **press Guide (Home)** or **hold Start for 3 seconds** (Start is preferred on Xbox One/PS5 pads so the controller doesn’t turn off). **Disclaimer:** The console must have been started at least once with the adapter connected; wake does **not** work from a cold start (e.g. console just plugged in or after a full power loss). In that case turn the console on with the front power button first.
- **PS3 wake from standby** — Same idea as 360: when the PS3 is in standby (turned off via **PS button → Turn off system**), you can wake it with **PS (Home)** or **hold Start for 3 seconds**—**only if the console keeps USB power when off**. Many PS3s cut power to the USB ports when shut down, so the adapter and controller disconnect; in that case wake is not possible. If your controller stays powered (e.g. charging light on) when the PS3 is off, wake may work. Same disclaimer as 360: no wake from cold start.

### Version 1.0.0.6a
- **PS1/PS2 (GPIO) output mode** — The adapter can output to a PS1 or PS2 console as a controller over GPIO (no USB device in this mode). Select via button combo **Start + B** or set a fixed driver build. **Wiring (standard Pico):** connect the board to the console’s controller port using DATA=GP19, COMMAND=GP20, ATTENTION/SEL=GP21, CLOCK=GP22, ACKNOWLEDGE=GP26. Plug your USB gamepad into the adapter’s USB port; the console sees a DualShock-style controller. _Protocol and PIO code ported from [PicoGamepadConverter](https://github.com/Loc15/PicoGamepadConverter)._
- **GameCube (GPIO) output mode** — The adapter can output to a GameCube or Wii (GameCube ports) as a controller over a single DATA line. Select via button combo **Start + X** or set a fixed driver build. **Wiring (standard Pico):** DATA=GP19, GND=GND; connect to the console’s controller port (single wire + ground). Plug your USB gamepad into the adapter’s USB port. _JoyBus protocol and PIO code ported from [PicoGamepadConverter](https://github.com/Loc15/PicoGamepadConverter)._
- **N64 (GPIO) output mode** — The adapter can output to a Nintendo 64 console as a controller over a single DATA line. Select via button combo **Start + Right Bumper** or set a fixed driver build. **Wiring (standard Pico):** DATA=GP19, GND=GND; connect to the N64 controller port (same pin as GameCube). Use any **wired (USB)** or **Bluetooth** (Pico W / Pico 2 W) gamepad as input. _Protocol and PIO send code ported from [pdaxrom/usb2n64-adapter](https://github.com/pdaxrom/usb2n64-adapter). Memory pak and rumble pak are not emulated._
- **Dreamcast (Maple Bus)** — **Input:** Read a real Dreamcast controller over GPIO (Pin A=GP10, B=GP11). **Output:** Use a USB or **Bluetooth** gamepad to control a Dreamcast: select **Start + Y** for Dreamcast mode, connect your BT or USB pad, wire the adapter’s Maple Bus (GP10/GP11) to the console’s controller port. Core1 runs the Maple device (responds to device info and GET_CONDITION); Core0 feeds gamepad state from USB/BT. When input source is **Dreamcast GPIO**, the bus is used as host only (read a DC pad). See [Dreamcast Port guide](Firmware/RP2040/docs/Dreamcast_Port.md). Maple Bus from [DreamPicoPort](https://github.com/OrangeFox86/DreamPicoPort).
- **Pin-outs and default mappings** — See [GPIO Output Pin-Out and Mappings](Firmware/RP2040/docs/GPIO_Output_Pinout_and_Mappings.md) for pin numbers (PS1/PS2, Dreamcast, GameCube, N64) and default button/stick mappings for each mode.
- **Bluetooth input for PS1/PS2, GameCube, Dreamcast, and N64** — On **Pico W** (or Pico 2 W), you can use a **Bluetooth controller** as input while outputting to PS1, PS2, GameCube, Dreamcast, or N64. Select the mode (**Start + B**, **Start + X**, **Start + Y**, or **Start + Right Bumper**) as usual; pair your BT gamepad; the console sees the adapter as a controller. Wiring is the same for each mode (PS1/PS2: DATA/CMD/ATT/CLK/ACK; GameCube/N64: DATA=GP19 + GND; Dreamcast: GP10/GP11).
- **GPIO input from real PS1/PS2, GameCube, N64, or Dreamcast controllers** — You can use a **real wired PS1/PS2, GameCube, N64, or Dreamcast controller** as the adapter’s input in two ways: (1) **Output to other consoles (Switch, Xbox, DInput, etc.):** set output mode (e.g. **Start + D-pad Down** for Switch), then hold **Start + Select** for ~2.5 s until the input source cycles to **PSX GPIO**, **GameCube GPIO**, **Dreamcast GPIO**, or **N64 GPIO**; plug the real controller into the GPIO pins and connect the adapter’s USB to the target console. (2) **Output to PS1/PS2, GameCube, or Dreamcast:** in that output mode, hold **Start + Select** to set input to the matching GPIO and plug in the real controller (same pins). **Wiring:** PS1/PS2: DATA=GP19, CMD=GP20, ATT=GP21, CLK=GP22; GameCube/N64: DATA=GP19 + GND; Dreamcast: GP10, GP11. _PSX host, JoyBus host, N64 host ported from [PicoGamepadConverter](https://github.com/Loc15/PicoGamepadConverter)._

**PS2 output mode improvements (v1.0.0.6a):**
- **Button polarity (active-low)** — The PS2 controller protocol uses active-low button bytes: **0xFF = released**, **0 = pressed**. The driver was sending 0 when no button was pressed, so the console read all buttons as pressed (e.g. constant D-pad Up and menu scrolling). Fixed by initialising the report with `buttons1 = buttons2 = 0xFF` and clearing bits when a button is pressed, so neutral/no-controller state is correct.
- **Left stick Y axis** — Left analog stick up/down was inverted on output. The mapping for left stick Y was corrected so physical stick up corresponds to the value the PS2 expects for up.
- **Protocol flow** — PS2 device (controller) protocol and escape-mode response lengths follow [PicoGamepadConverter](https://github.com/Loc15/PicoGamepadConverter) and [DS4toPS2](https://github.com/TonyMacDonald1995/DS4toPS2) (single response byte then command, 7-byte escape responses with leading 0x5A) for broad console compatibility.
- **OPL (Open PS2 Loader)** — On Pico W, the main loop now drains all pending PS2 transactions each tick so rapid pad init (e.g. OPL at startup) does not desync or hang. **Keep the controller connected at boot** when using OPL; the PS2 pad driver typically does not re-detect controllers plugged in after an app has started, so unplugging then replugging will not give input in OPL. If OPL hangs (black screen) or inputs stop being registered, **power-cycle the Pico** (unplug and replug the adapter) so the PS2 link resets; the adapter also primes 0xFF after a desync drain so the next transaction is valid. **DualSense (PS5) over Bluetooth:** the Options button (Start) may not be reported as Start by the BT stack in some cases; if Options doesn’t work in OPL or in-game, try an Xbox or other controller, or use the DualSense over USB if your board supports it.

### Version 1.0.0.5a
- **Switch Pro emulation** — Switch output mode now emulates a **Nintendo Switch Pro Controller** over USB (report format, subcommands, init handshake). Face-button and report layout follow the standard Pro Controller protocol (bit layout aligned with hardware/reference). _Switch Pro protocol and button report layout reference: [retro-pico-switch](https://github.com/DavidPagels/retro-pico-switch) (N64/GameCube → Pico → Switch); Bluepad32 Switch parser used for validation._
- **Waveshare RP2350-USB-A board support** — Build with `-DOGXM_BOARD=RP2350_USB_A` for the Waveshare RP2350-USB-A (wired USB host + RGB LED). _Board support from upstream [OGX-Mini](https://github.com/wiredopposite/OGX-Mini/commit/68bdec451077a33b0b1247ce01ed30e470163dea)._
- **Additional board support** — **RP2350_ZERO** (Waveshare RP2350-Zero), **RP2040_XIAO** (Seeed Studio XIAO RP2040), and **RP2354**. All use the same Standard (PIO-USB host) firmware path; build with `-DOGXM_BOARD=RP2350_ZERO`, `RP2040_XIAO`, or `RP2354`. _Board support from [Sakura-Research-Lab/OGX-Mini-2026-Testing](https://github.com/Sakura-Research-Lab/OGX-Mini-2026-Testing)._
- **8BitDo XInput (Xbox 360) fix** — Wired 8BitDo controllers (VID 0x2DC8, PID 0x3016 / 0x3106) are detected and sent a repeating LED-off keepalive so they stay connected and stable. _From [Sakura-Research-Lab/OGX-Mini-2026-Testing](https://github.com/Sakura-Research-Lab/OGX-Mini-2026-Testing)._
- **Switch analog stick sensitivity** — Slight sensitivity increase (1.2× gain) for analog sticks in Switch Pro emulation mode; configurable via `STICK_GAIN_NUM` / `STICK_GAIN_DEN` in `Switch.cpp`.
- **Original Xbox (OG) Guide button behavior** — In OG Xbox mode, the Guide (SYS) button is mapped to Start; **tap** = Start, **hold 1 s** = soft IGR (LT+RT+Start+Back), **hold 3 s** = system shutdown (LT+RT+D-pad Up+Back). _Implementation based on [Sakura-Research-Lab/OGX-Mini-2026-Testing](https://github.com/Sakura-Research-Lab/OGX-Mini-2026-Testing)._

### Version 1.0.0.4a
- **Wii (Wiimote) output mode** — On Pico W and Pico 2 W, build with `-DOGXM_FIXED_DRIVER=WII` for a Wii-only firmware. The adapter appears as a Wiimote over Bluetooth; use a USB gamepad on the external PIO USB port. Supports No Extension, Nunchuk, and Classic Controller report modes (cycle with Home + D-pad Down). See [Wii Mode Guide](Firmware/RP2040/docs/Wii_Mode_Guide.md). _Approach and mappings based on [PicoGamepadConverter](https://github.com/wiredopposite/PicoGamepadConverter)._
- Xbox 360 no longer requires the USB patch to authenticate, uses the same authentication as Joypad-OS to do official handshake with Retail consoles. Homebrew/ Jailbreaking is no longer required to use the XINPUT mode on 360 but it will no longer output to PC.
- **Rumble fix for Xbox 360 controllers** — Rumble on 360 pads is now handled correctly when using the adapter (including wireless RUMBLE_ENABLE sequence). _Xbox 360 vibration/rumble handling attributed to [faithvoid](https://github.com/faithvoid) on GitHub._
- **Pico 2 / Pico 2 W build fixes** — Firmware builds and runs correctly on RP2350 (Pico 2 and Pico 2 W).
- Improved latency on Xbox 360 and PS3 controllers.
- **PS3 mode:** Home (PS) button works with DS4/DS5 over Bluetooth (8-frame latch so short taps register). Analog sticks now match DualShock 3 spec: full 0–255 range, center 0x80 (128), ~1.5% deadzone for accurate emulation. See [IMPROVEMENTS.md](Firmware/RP2040/docs/IMPROVEMENTS.md#ps3-mode--input-delays-stuck-inputs-home-button-and-analog-stick-emulation).
- Added build flags so you can make it only output in a specific mode and disable mode switching.
- Using a PS5 controller allows you to tap the touchpad to enable or disable the adaptive triggers.

### Version 1.0.0.3a patched
- Ability to emulate the GameCube controller adapter for Wii U. (Also tested on Switch 1/ 2)
- Wii U & Switch Pro controllers are supported fully with working LT and RT
- Wii Remotes are supported along with the following controllers connected: Nunchuck/ GameCube/ Wii Gamepad.
- Disconnection Combo has been added: Start+Select for most controllers, L3+R3 for OUYA controllers.

- Output to the following consoles:
      - ~~PS2~~ (done: PS1/PS2 GPIO mode, see changelog)
      - ~~GameCube~~ (done: GameCube GPIO mode, see changelog)
      - DreamCast
      - NES
      - SNES
      - Genesis
      - Master System

## Hardware
For Pi Pico, RP2040-Zero, 4 channel, and ESP32 configurations, please see the hardware folder for diagrams.

I've designed a PCB for the RP2040-Zero so you can make a small form-factor adapter yourself. The gerber files, schematic, and BOM are in Hardware folder.

<img src="images/OGX-Mini-rpzero-int.jpg" alt="OGX-Mini Boards" width="400">

If you would like a prebuilt unit, you can purchase one, with cable and Xbox adapter included, from the original creators store: [**Etsy store**](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1426992904/ogx-mini-controller-adapter-for-original).

## Adding supported controllers
If your third party controller isn't working, but the original version is listed above, send me the device's VID and PID and I'll add it so it's recognized properly.

## Build
### RP2040
Build with **CMake** from the `Firmware/RP2040` directory. You can compile for different boards with the CMake argument ```OGXM_BOARD```:

- ```PI_PICO``` 
- ```PI_PICO2``` 
- ```PI_PICOW``` 
- ```PI_PICO2W``` 
- ```RP2040_ZERO``` (Waveshare RP2040-Zero)
- ```RP2350_USB_A``` (Waveshare RP2350-USB-A)
- ```RP2350_ZERO``` (Waveshare RP2350-Zero)
- ```RP2040_XIAO``` (Seeed Studio XIAO RP2040)
- ```RP2354```
- ```ADAFRUIT_FEATHER``` 
- ```ESP32_BLUEPAD32_I2C```
- ```ESP32_BLUERETRO_I2C``` 
- ```EXTERNAL_4CH_I2C```

You can also set ```MAX_GAMEPADS``` (if &gt; 1, only DInput/PS3 and Switch Pro are supported). **Optional:** ```OGXM_FIXED_DRIVER``` to lock output mode (e.g. ```XINPUT```, ```PS3```); ```OGXM_FIXED_DRIVER_ALLOW_COMBOS=ON``` to keep combos when fixed. ```MAIN_LOOP_DELAY_US``` (default ```0```) sets main-loop delay for lower CPU use (e.g. ```250```).

You'll need git, python3, CMake, Ninja and the GCC ARM toolchain installed. CMake scripts will patch some files in Bluepad32 and BTStack and also make sure all git submodules (plus their submodules and dependencies) are downloaded.

**Interactive build scripts:** From the project root, run **`scripts/build.sh`** (Linux/macOS) or **`scripts/build.ps1`** (Windows PowerShell) to be guided through board selection, default vs fixed output mode, Release/Debug, and build. The script checks for required tools, creates **`scripts/build`** for the build output, and on failure can optionally save a log in the `scripts` folder.
Here's an example on Windows (manual build):
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/MegaCadeDev/OGX-Mini-2026.git
cd OGX-Mini-2026/Firmware/RP2040
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DOGXM_BOARD=PI_PICOW -DMAX_GAMEPADS=1
cmake --build build
```
Outputs (`.elf`, `.uf2`, etc.) are in the build directory; flash the `.uf2` to the board. Or use the GCC ARM toolchain and CMake Tools extension in VSCode.

**Latency:** The adapter sends the latest gamepad state whenever the USB endpoint is free (XInput and similar), and the main loop has no added delay by default, so the host gets updates at its poll rate with minimal latency. See [Firmware/RP2040/docs/IMPROVEMENTS.md](Firmware/RP2040/docs/IMPROVEMENTS.md#latency-reduction) for details.

### Firmware documentation
| Document | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [Wii_Mode_Guide.md](Firmware/RP2040/docs/Wii_Mode_Guide.md) | Wii mode (build-option only): No Extension / Nunchuk / Classic, USB host, sync and auto-connect, button mapping. |
| [PICO2W_WII_USB_SETUP.md](Firmware/RP2040/docs/PICO2W_WII_USB_SETUP.md) | Pico 2 W / Pico W: USB host wiring (PIO USB), pins, build, troubleshooting for Wii mode. |
| [IMPROVEMENTS.md](Firmware/RP2040/docs/IMPROVEMENTS.md) | Firmware improvements: PS3 fixes, latency, XInput/360. |

### ESP32
Please see the Hardware directory for a diagram showing how to hookup the ESP32 to your RP2040.

You will need ESP-IDF v5.1, esptool, python3, and git installed. If you use VSCode, you can install the ESP-IDF extension and configure the project for ESP-IDF v5.1, it'll download everything for you and then you just click the build button at the bottom of the window.

When you build with ESP-IDF, Cmake will run a python script that copies the necessary BTStack files into the components directory, this is needed since BTStack isn't configured as an ESP-IDF component when you download it with git.
