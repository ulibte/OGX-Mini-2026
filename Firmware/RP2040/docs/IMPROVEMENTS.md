# Firmware Improvements

Improvements and fixes applied to the OGX-Mini RP2040 firmware in this project.

**Version:** From **v1.0.0a3** the version was bumped to **v1.0.0a4** to reflect Wii U controller fixes, Gamecube USB mode, PS3 driver fixes, latency improvements, and Xbox 360 (XInput) support (see below).

---

## Xbox 360 (XInput) support

**Goal:** Use the adapter in XInput mode on Xbox 360 with Bluetooth controllers (e.g. PS5, Xbox One). The 360 requires XSM3 authentication and specific USB descriptors.

**References:** [joypad-os](https://github.com/joypad-ai/joypad-os) XInput implementation; [libxsm3](https://github.com/InvoxiPlayGames/libxsm3).

### Changes

1. **Descriptors**
   - Device and configuration descriptors aligned with joypad-os (153-byte config, 4 interfaces, bConfigurationValue 1, bMaxPower 0xFA).
   - Configuration callback returns `nullptr` for `index != 0` (single config).
   - String descriptor index 4 (XSM3 security) uses a 96-character buffer and the full string (no 31-char truncation).

2. **XSM3 authentication**
   - XSM3 state is initialized at driver init (not in the 0x81 callback).
   - Challenge init (0x82) and verify (0x87) data are stored when received; crypto (`xsm3_do_challenge_init` / `xsm3_do_challenge_verify`) runs in the main loop (`process()`), not in the USB callback.
   - 0x83 responses: 46 bytes for init, 22 bytes for verify.
   - 0x86 state: 1 = processing, 2 = response ready.

3. **USB on Pico 2 W**
   - USB is initialized before Core1 (Bluetooth) so the 360 can enumerate and run XSM3 even if BT firmware is still loading.

4. **Control handling**
   - Vendor and class control requests are forwarded to the active driver so XSM3 traffic reaches the XInput handler.

Descriptors and XSM3 flow are aligned with [joypad-os](https://github.com/joypad-ai/joypad-os); a local comparison doc may be kept out of the repo for reference.

## PS3 mode — input delays, stuck inputs, Home button, and analog stick emulation

**Source:** Fixes from [OGX-Mini-Plus](https://github.com/guimaraf/OGX-Mini-Plus) (v1.1.1) — *“PS3 Driver Fixes - Fixed input delays and stuck inputs.”* Plus subsequent improvements for Home (PS) button and DS3-accurate analog sticks.

**Files:** `src/USBDevice/DeviceDriver/PS3/PS3.cpp`, `src/Descriptors/PS3.h`

### Changes

1. **L2/R2 axis values**
   - `report_in_.l2_axis` and `report_in_.r2_axis` are now set from `gp_in.trigger_l` and `gp_in.trigger_r`.
   - Previously left at zero, which could cause stuck or incorrect trigger behaviour on PS3. Filling these is required for many PS3 games.

2. **DualShock 3–accurate analog sticks**
   - Sticks now match the real DS3/Sixaxis HID spec:
     - **Range:** 0–255 (full 8-bit; was 0–254).
     - **Center:** **0x80 (128)** at rest and in deadzone (was 0x7F). Matches Linux gamepad spec and HID logical max 255.
     - **Deadzone:** ~1.5% (512 on ±32768) so small movements register without drift; in deadzone the report sends 0x80.
     - **Scaling:** Linear map from signed 16-bit input to 0–255 with correct rounding so center (0) → 128.
   - Reduces stick drift and matches console expectations for DS3-compatible games.

3. **D-pad in analog mode**
   - When `gamepad.analog_enabled()` is true, D-pad axes (`up_axis`, `down_axis`, `left_axis`, `right_axis`) are now derived from the **digital** D-pad bits instead of `gp_in.analog[ANALOG_OFF_*]`.
   - Prevents noisy analog D-pad values from causing stuck or wrong D-pad input on PS3.

4. **Face button axes (digital / non-analog branch)**
   - Corrected mapping so that:
     - `circle_axis` = BUTTON_B (was BUTTON_X)
     - `cross_axis` = BUTTON_A (was BUTTON_B)
     - `square_axis` = BUTTON_X (was BUTTON_A)
   - Circle / Cross / Square now match the intended face buttons.

5. **Home (PS) button**
   - Report is built only when `tud_hid_ready()` (right before send), using `gamepad.get_pad_in()` so the console gets the latest state (helps with DS4/DS5 over Bluetooth).
   - **PS button latch:** When `BUTTON_SYS` is set, the driver latches the PS bit for 8 consecutive report frames so short taps are not missed by timing. `buttons[2]` bit 0 (PS) and bit 1 (Touchpad) are set from `BUTTON_SYS` and `BUTTON_MISC`.
   - If Home does not work over Bluetooth, try a wired controller (some consoles only react to the first controller's Home).

## Latency reduction

**Goal:** Reduce input-to-output latency in the device (Core0) main loop, especially for XInput with Bluetooth controllers (PS5, Xbox One).

### Main loop delay

- **Before:** The device loop used `sleep_ms(1)` every iteration, then a configurable `MAIN_LOOP_DELAY_US` (default 250 µs).
- **After:**
  - **Default: 0 µs** — no added delay; loop runs as fast as possible for minimum latency (low-latency default).
  - **250+ µs** — set via CMake (e.g. `-DMAIN_LOOP_DELAY_US=250`) to reduce CPU use if desired.

**Files changed:**

- `src/Board/Config.h` — `MAIN_LOOP_DELAY_US` default **0**; override via CMake.
- `src/OGXMini/Board/Standard.cpp`, `PicoW.cpp`, `Four_Channel_I2C.cpp` — use `sleep_us(MAIN_LOOP_DELAY_US)` when `> 0`.
- `CMakeLists.txt` — `MAIN_LOOP_DELAY_US` cache variable (default 0).

### XInput: always send latest state

In XInput mode, the adapter no longer sends a report only when `gamepad.new_pad_in()` is true. It **always** reads the current gamepad state and sends whenever the USB IN endpoint is free. That way the host (e.g. 360) gets updates at its poll interval (4 ms) with the freshest state, instead of being limited by how often the BT stack sets “new input.” Reduces perceived latency with PS5/Xbox One over Bluetooth.

**File:** `src/USBDevice/DeviceDriver/XInput/XInput.cpp` — `process()` always builds and sends the report; no gate on `new_pad_in()`.

### Switch and PS3: latest state when USB ready

- **Switch (Pro emulation):** Each `process()` call reads fresh `get_pad_in()`, builds the report, and sends when `tud_hid_n_ready(0)`. No `new_pad_in()` gate — the host gets the latest state every time the IN endpoint is free.
- **PS3:** Report is built only when `tud_hid_ready()`; when ready, it uses `get_pad_in()` so the console always receives the latest state. Same low-latency pattern as XInput.

### Main loop order: tud_task() before process()

The main loop now calls **`tud_task()` before** `device_driver->process()`. That way the USB stack updates completion status of the previous IN transfer first; then `process()` sees the endpoint as ready and can send the next report immediately with the latest gamepad state. Reduces latency by up to one main-loop iteration (avoids sending only every other loop when the host polls frequently).

**Files:** `src/OGXMini/Board/PicoW.cpp`, `Standard.cpp`, `Four_Channel_I2C.cpp` — order is `process_tasks()` → `tud_task()` → `process()` for each gamepad.

### How to use

| Goal | Setting |
|------|--------|
| Low latency (default) | Use default `MAIN_LOOP_DELAY_US=0`. |
| Lower CPU use | Configure with e.g. `-DMAIN_LOOP_DELAY_US=250`. |

### Notes

- Core1 (Bluetooth / gamepad) runs with no sleep in its loop.
- USB full-speed poll interval (e.g. 4 ms for XInput) still applies; the improvement is that each report carries the **latest** input and the main loop adds no extra delay by default.
- Bluetooth adds latency; the changes above minimize the adapter’s contribution.

## Additional board support (RP2350_ZERO, RP2040_XIAO, RP2354)

**Source:** [Sakura-Research-Lab/OGX-Mini-2026-Testing](https://github.com/Sakura-Research-Lab/OGX-Mini-2026-Testing).

Three additional boards use the same Standard (PIO-USB host) code path as PI_PICO, RP2040_ZERO, ADAFRUIT_FEATHER, and RP2350_USB_A:

| Board | CMake option | Notes |
|-------|--------------|--------|
| Waveshare RP2350-Zero | `OGXM_BOARD=RP2350_ZERO` | PIO USB D+ = GP10, RGB = GP16; RP2350. |
| Seeed Studio XIAO RP2040 | `OGXM_BOARD=RP2040_XIAO` | PIO USB D+ = GP0, RGB = GP12, LED = GP17. |
| RP2354 | `OGXM_BOARD=RP2354` | PIO USB D+ = GP0, LED = GP25; RP2350. |

**Files:** `src/Board/Config.h` (board IDs and pin defines), `src/OGXMini/OGXMini.cpp` (init/run/host_mounted tables), `src/OGXMini/Board/Standard.cpp` (extended `#if`), `CMakeLists.txt` (board branches).

## 8BitDo XInput (Xbox 360) host fix

**Source:** [Sakura-Research-Lab/OGX-Mini-2026-Testing](https://github.com/Sakura-Research-Lab/OGX-Mini-2026-Testing).

Some 8BitDo wired XInput controllers (VID 0x2DC8, PID 0x3016 or 0x3106) can disconnect or behave oddly if the host leaves the controller LED on. The Xbox 360 host driver now detects these devices by VID/PID and schedules a repeating delayed task (every 1 s) that sends “LED off” to the controller. Other controllers are unchanged (LED stays on as before).

**File:** `src/USBHost/HostDriver/XInput/Xbox360.cpp` — `initialize()` calls `tuh_vid_pid_get()`, and if 8BitDo, queues `TaskQueue::Core1::queue_delayed_task(..., 1000, true, set_led(..., false))`.

---

## Switch Pro — analog stick sensitivity

A configurable sensitivity gain is applied to the analog sticks in Switch Pro emulation. Raw stick values (outside the deadzone) are scaled by **STICK_GAIN_NUM / STICK_GAIN_DEN** (default 120/100 = 1.2×) before mapping to the 12-bit Switch report. The same physical deflection produces slightly larger output for a more responsive feel.

**File:** `src/USBDevice/DeviceDriver/Switch/Switch.cpp` — `gamepad_to_switch_report()`; tune via `STICK_GAIN_NUM` and `STICK_GAIN_DEN`.

---

## Summary

| Area | Improvement |
|------|-------------|
| **XInput (360)** | XSM3 authentication and descriptors aligned with joypad-os; adapter works on Xbox 360 with BT controllers (PS5, Xbox One). 8BitDo wired fix: LED keepalive for VID 0x2DC8 / PID 0x3016 or 0x3106. |
| **PS3** | Stuck inputs and delays addressed via L2/R2 axes; DS3-accurate sticks (0–255, center 0x80, ~1.5% deadzone); D-pad and face button mapping; Home (PS) button with 8-frame latch for BT controllers. |
| **Switch Pro** | Analog stick sensitivity gain (default 1.2×) for more responsive sticks; configurable in `Switch.cpp`. |
| **Boards** | RP2350_ZERO, RP2040_XIAO, RP2354 supported (Standard/PIO-USB host path). |
| **Latency** | Main loop delay default **0 µs**; `tud_task()` before `process()` so reports send every loop when ready; XInput/Switch/PS3 send latest state when USB ready (no `new_pad_in()` gate). |
